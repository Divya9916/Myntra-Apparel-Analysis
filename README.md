# Myntra-Apparel-Analysis
Analyzed Myntra apparel data in Excel by cleaning, standardizing, and exploring pricing, discounts, sizes, and ratings. Used XLOOKUP, INDEX–MATCH, COUNTIF, and AVERAGEIF to uncover insights on top-rated products, high discounts, and size availability for data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Myntra’s apparel dataset to extract actionable insights that support data-driven business decisions. The dataset contains product details such as pricing, discounts, sizes, and customer ratings. Using Microsoft Excel, the data was cleaned, standardized, and analyzed to uncover trends in pricing, discounts, and customer preferences.
